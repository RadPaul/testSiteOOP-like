# testSite
To-do list:
1. Fill out file php/data.php with your parameters;
2. Run php/install.php file to create needed database and tables;
3. Enjoy.

Project is made with:
-HTML;
-CSS (SASS);
-Javascript;
-PHP;
-MySQL

Original database and tables were made via PHPMyAdmin.

Multilanguage feature isn't implemented.

Changes vs testSite
-OOP style back-end;
-updated registration form (actually there was only form for registration and logging in so any mistakes in username caused new profile registration);
-website is now using only 1 page 'index.php' instead of 3 different pages.
